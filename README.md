# My Angular Blog

Little app which I wrote in order to learn Angular basics. It follows Chapter 2 (Building a SPA application with Scully and Angular router) of the book <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/product/angular-projects-second-edition/9781800205260" target="_blank">*Angular Projects 2nd edition*</a>.

<br>

It's a blog-like app, which features a fast, statically generated collection of articles. It makes use of many Angular and Scully patterns: routing, lazy loading, dependency injection, static content generation, etc.

<br>

The instructions in the book are clear and easy to follow. However the subject matter itself is quite challenging. Angular is verbose and complex, so the learning curve is steep.

<br>

But it was fun, and I look forward to the other 10 chapters!

<br>

By the way, I published the project live, using github pages. Please find it <a href="https://claudiu-codreanu.github.io/ng-my-blog/" target="_blank">**here**</a>.
