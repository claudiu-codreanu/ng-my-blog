# Pangrams

Pangrams are sentences which include every single letter of the alphabet (A - Z) at least once.

A perfect pangram includes every single letter **once and only once**.

I'm sure you've heard at least once this most popular pangram:

    - The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

Below are other examples, which I've found at <a href="https://people.howstuffworks.com/14-pangrams.htm" target="_blank">how stuff works:</a>

    - Waltz, bad nymph, for quick jigs vex.
    - Quick zephyrs blow, vexing daft Jim.
    - Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow.
    - Two driven jocks help fax my big quiz.
    - Five quacking zephyrs jolt my wax bed.
    - The five boxing wizards jump quickly.
    - Jinxed wizards pluck ivy from the big quilt.

Some of them don't even sound like English, they look like an alien language... but that's what makes them cool!
