# About this app

I wrote this app by following Chapter 2 (Building a SPA application with Scully and Angular router) of the book <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/product/angular-projects-second-edition/9781800205260" target="_blank">*Angular Projects 2nd edition*</a>.

It's a blog-like app, which makes use of many Angular and Scully patterns (routing, lazy loading, dependency injection, static content generation, etc.)

The instructions are clear and easy to follow, but the subject matter itself is a tad challenging. Angular is verbose and complex, so the learning curve is steep.

But it was fun, and I look forward to the other ten chapters!
